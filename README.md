‚úÖ LLD Interview Answer Template (Senior SDE)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clarify Requirements

"Let me clarify the core requirements first..."

What features should the system support?

What are the edge cases / failure conditions?

Are there any constraints (scale, real-time, concurrency)?

Functional vs. Non-functional (performance, fault tolerance, extensibility)

üß† Helps set a strong tone and avoid wrong assumptions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify Core Entities / Objects

"From the requirements, the main entities seem to be..."

List key classes: User, Vehicle, Slot, etc.

Note any enums: VehicleType, PaymentStatus

Highlight their responsibilities using SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

üß† Think in terms of objects and their responsibilities.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Define Relationships & Interactions

"Let‚Äôs map out how these classes interact..."

Use terms like one-to-many, composition, aggregation

Consider inheritance or interfaces where needed

üß† Mention why you're using composition vs inheritance.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Design Class Diagram (Verbally or Sketch UML)

"Here‚Äôs a high-level structure of the classes..."

Explain properties and methods briefly

Keep classes modular and cohesive

üß† Keep your design testable, clean, and extensible.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Interface & Design Patterns (If applicable)

"To keep the system extensible, I‚Äôll introduce an interface..."

Strategy for flexible behavior

Factory for creation logic

Observer for notification

Singleton for shared resources

üß† Bonus points if you can justify patterns used.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Concurrency / Thread Safety

"Let‚Äôs discuss how this design behaves under concurrent scenarios..."

Use ConcurrentHashMap, locks, synchronization

Mention read/write patterns and shared resources

üß† Very important in system like Cache, Queue, Notification.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage / Persistence (Optional)

"If we were persisting this data..."

What to store (users, events, logs)

Type of DB: SQL vs NoSQL

Schema design (briefly)

8Ô∏è‚É£ Edge Cases & Fault Handling

"Now considering failure and edge scenarios..."

Null inputs

Exhausted resources (e.g. parking full)

Invalid state transitions

9Ô∏è‚É£ Testing & Extensibility

"This design can be tested and extended easily because..."

Mention mockable interfaces

Add new types (e.g., new notification channels, new payment modes)

1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Wrap-Up & Trade-offs

"To wrap up..."

Summarize how your design meets the requirements

Acknowledge any trade-offs (e.g., simplicity vs performance)
