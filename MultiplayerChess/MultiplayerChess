Designing a Multiplayer Chess Game (LLD) is a classic system design problem that tests your understanding of:

Object-Oriented Design (OOP)

Real-time communication (e.g., WebSocket)

Game state management

Turn-based systems

Handling edge cases like undo, draw, checkmate, resign, etc.



âœ… 1. Core Requirements
Functional:
Two players can play a chess game.

Enforce chess rules (valid moves, check, checkmate).

Maintain the state of the game.

Track history of moves (for undo, draw, replay).

Support resign, draw, rematch.

Non-functional (if needed):
Real-time updates.

Scalable to multiple games simultaneously.

Secure and cheat-resistant.




Optional Enhancements (for Real-World System)
Add GameManager class to manage all active games.

Use WebSocket or pub-sub (Kafka) for real-time events.

Support AI-based bots.

Add timer per player.

Store game history in a database.

Implement full move validation (e.g., check, checkmate, en passant, castling).

Rate limiting per player to avoid spam moves.
