âœ… Requirements

Build a Logger System that:

Supports multiple log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR

Can write logs to multiple appenders: Console, File, DB, etc.

Is thread-safe

Supports asynchronous logging (non-blocking)

Can filter logs based on configured log level

Can be easily extended (new appenders, new formats)




ðŸ§± High-Level Design
Key Components:
Component	Description
Logger	Public interface used by clients to log messages
LogManager	Singleton managing logger instances
LogMessage	POJO for log entry (message, level, timestamp)
Appender (Interface)	ConsoleAppender, FileAppender, etc.
AsyncDispatcher	Background thread that pulls log messages and dispatches them to appenders
LogLevel	Enum for log levels (DEBUG, INFO, etc.)

ðŸ§  Core Concepts Used
Thread-safe logging using a blocking queue.

Async log dispatching to avoid blocking the main thread.

Open/Closed Principle â€” Add new appenders without modifying core logic.

Strategy Pattern â€” Appenders handle different output strategies.




âœ¨ Extensions (for follow-up questions)

Add file appender with BufferedWriter

Add log rotation

Add log format customization

Add batching and retry for DB writes

Add log configuration loader (XML, JSON, or YAML-based)



Next:

A file-based appender implementation?

A multi-threaded stress test setup?

The HLD + LLD diagrams as an export?
