âœ… Problem Statement

Design a simplified in-memory key-value store (like Redis) that:

Supports basic put(key, value) and get(key)

Optional TTL (time-to-live) for entries

Thread-safe (multiple threads can read/write safely)

Eviction policy like LRU when memory is full (optional)

O(1) get and put operations

Extensible to support more data types later



ðŸ§© Key Concepts to Include
Feature	Detail
Thread Safety	Using locks or concurrent data structures
TTL Support	Background thread to expire old keys
Eviction (LRU)	Optional but shows depth
Time Complexity	O(1) for get and put
Extensibility	Use generics or abstraction to support multiple value types



ðŸš€ Extensions (for deeper discussion)
Feature	Approach
LRU Cache	Combine LinkedHashMap or use LinkedHashSet + HashMap
Multiple Data Types	Use wrapper for String, List, Set, etc.
Persistence	Append-only file log (AOF) or snapshot
Sharding/Cluster	Hash key to different node
Pub/Sub	Add listeners on channels
Transactions	Queue commands and execute atomically



âœ… Summary
Weâ€™ve now designed a Redis-like In-Memory Key-Value Store with:

Thread-safe get/put

TTL support and background expiry

Easily extendable core

Option to build in LRU eviction, persistence, pub-sub, etc.


Next:

Add LRU eviction next?

Extend to support multiple data types like Redis?
