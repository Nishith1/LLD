📌 Problem Statement

Design a system that provides real-time search suggestions (autocomplete) as a user types a query in a search bar.

✅ Requirements
🔹 Functional Requirements:
User types a query, and suggestions should appear in real-time.

Suggestions should be relevant and ordered (by popularity, recency, frequency, etc.).

Support for prefix matching.

Allow updating or learning new search terms over time.

🔹 Non-Functional Requirements:
Low latency (suggestions within milliseconds).

Scalable to millions of search terms.

High availability and fault tolerance.

Trie / Ternary Search Tree + Ranking Info

[Optional] Popularity Store (e.g., Redis, DB)



📦 Core Components

Trie Data Structure — for efficient prefix matching

Ranking Engine — ranks suggestions based on frequency/popularity

SearchHistoryStore (Optional) — stores recent search frequency for learning

AutocompleteService — main business logic

Suggestion API — REST endpoint for client




⚙️ Features You Can Extend
Feature	Extension Idea
Frequency Learning	Add a Map<String, Integer> to track popularity and update frequency dynamically
Real-time Learning	Add insert() endpoint to insert new words
Caching	Use Redis for storing hot prefix results
Auto-expire Trends	Evict old terms using TTL or popularity decay
Distributed Trie	Split Trie across nodes by prefix hash
Sharding	Prefix A-F in one node, G-L in another, etc.
Analytics	Track usage metrics for personalization



💬 Interview Discussion Points
Why use Trie over HashMap or DB?

How to keep the Trie updated in real-time?

How would you handle typos (fuzzy search)?

How would you handle millions of search terms efficiently?

How to implement search ranking (ML/Heuristics/Weights)?

How to keep suggestions consistent across distributed nodes?



Next:

Add REST APIs for adding words or feedback loop?

Make it distributed and scalable with Kafka or Redis?

Include ML ranking hints?

Let me know, and I’ll expand it accordingly!
