ðŸšª Problem: Fixed window allows burst traffic at boundaries
Imagine:

You allow 10 requests per 60 seconds.

A user sends 10 requests at 10:00:59 and then 10 more at 10:01:00 â€” theyâ€™ve done 20 in 1 second!

ðŸ“‰ This is where Sliding Window Log shines.


âœ… Sliding Window Log â€“ Core Idea
Instead of grouping requests in fixed windows, log each request timestamp and:

Allow a request only if the number of requests in the last X seconds is below threshold.

ðŸ§  Data Structure
For each user, store a queue of timestamps.

Map<String, Deque<Long>> userRequestLog;


When a new request comes in:

Remove timestamps older than (now - windowSize)

If queue size < limit â†’ allow and append timestamp

Else â†’ block the request


ðŸš€ Benefits of Sliding Window Log
Prevents sudden traffic bursts

Finer-grained control

Easy to understand

Interview-friendly
