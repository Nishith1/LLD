What is Sliding Window Counter?
Think of it as a compromise between:

Fixed window (simple, fast, but inaccurate)

Sliding window log (accurate, but memory-heavy)


💡 Key Idea:
Break your time window (e.g., 60 seconds) into smaller fixed intervals (e.g., 6 intervals of 10 seconds each), and count requests in each interval.

When a request arrives:

Remove counts from expired intervals

Sum requests in relevant intervals

If total < max limit → allow, else → block


🧠 Real-World Analogy
It's like having a rolling histogram of how many requests happened in the last 60 seconds. You’re always summing the last N intervals.


🔍 Benefits
Feature	Sliding Window Counter
Memory	✅ Lower than logs
Accuracy	✅ Better than fixed window
Implementation	✅ Intermediate complexity
Production-ready	✅ Yes

 Recap
Best of both worlds: balances accuracy + performance.

Great talking point in interviews when discussing scalability.

You can scale it across shards/partitions for distributed systems.
