ðŸª£ What is Token Bucket?
A bucket holds tokens, and:

Each token allows 1 request

Tokens are added at a fixed rate

Requests consume tokens

If not enough tokens â†’ request is rejected

Unlike leaky bucket, bursts are allowed if tokens are available.



ðŸ’¡ Real-world analogy:
Imagine:

You get 10 tokens per second

Your bucket can hold 50 tokens max

You can save up tokens if unused, then burst later

This is what makes Token Bucket burst-tolerant, unlike Fixed Window or Sliding Counter.



ðŸ§  Components of the Design
capacity: max number of tokens in bucket

refillRate: tokens added per second

lastRefillTimestamp: last time tokens were added

tokens: current available tokens
